# SEO Strategy: Ranking #1 for SJD Interior Insights

Getting your content to rank #1 on Google requires a combination of **Technical SEO** (which we have already built into your site) and **Content Strategy**.

## 1. Technical SEO (Already Implemented)
We have already optimized the foundation of your site:
- **Fast Loading**: Using Astro SSR with minimal JavaScript.
- **Micro-animations**: Keeps users engaged (improves "dwell time").
- **Meta Tags**: Dynamic titles and descriptions from Strapi are injected into every page.
- **Sitemap**: Automatically generated at `https://sjdinterior.com/sitemap-index.xml`.
- **Structured Data**: JSON-LD schema (Article, LocalBusiness) is active to help Google understand your content.

## 2. On-Page SEO Checklist (In Strapi)
When you add a new "Insight" in Strapi, follow these rules:
- **Title**: Must be catchy and include your target keyword. (e.g., "7 Tips Interior Rumah Minimalis").
- **SEO Title**: Make it 50-60 characters. This is what appears in Google.
- **SEO Description**: 150-160 characters. Needs to be a "hook" to make people click.
- **Slug**: Keep it short and keyword-rich (e.g., `/insight/tips-interior-minimalis`).
- **Focus Keywords**: Repeat your main keyword subtly in the first paragraph and in at least one `H2` heading.

## 3. High-Quality Content Rules
Google rewards content that is:
- **Original & Expert**: Share your real experience as a professional designer.
- **Visual**: Use high-quality images. We have protected your images (anti-save) to ensure your portfolio remains exclusive.
- **Scannable**: Use `H2` and `H3` headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs. People don't read; they scan.
- **Internal Linking**: Link to your other "Insight" articles or your "Portfolio" within the text.

## 4. Google Search Console (CRITICAL)
If you haven't yet, you **MUST** do this:
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://searchconsole.google.com/).
2. Add your property: `https://sjdinterior.com`.
3. Submit your Sitemap: `https://sjdinterior.com/sitemap-index.xml`.
4. Monitor "Core Web Vitals" – your site should get a "Green" score because of our Astro optimization.

## 5. Keyword Research
Don't guess what people want. Use free tools like:
- **Google Suggest**: Type "Interior rumah" in Google and see what it suggests at the bottom.
- **Google Trends**: See what's trending in Indonesia regarding interior design.
- **AnswerThePublic**: Find common questions people ask (Great for FAQ sections!).
